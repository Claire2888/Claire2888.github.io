                I've been thinking a lot about values in terms of previous companies that I have work with and the values that I have looked for in them to determine whether I would enjoy working there and be a good fit. I think this has really helped me in the past to figure out the culture of a place that I would be working for but in terms of my identity I think it has been the most important for my values to align with them. For me I think what comes top of mind for values is honesty, passion and growth. Honesty I value as important for open communication, passion is important for me in going after what I enjoy and am excited about in life and growth in terms of always learning and evolving. 
                I'm attending Dev Academy because I was after a new challenge within my digital career and a friend who is a QA tester recommended it to me. I've always been interested in coding and am intrigued to see where this path takes me. I was also working for Canada Learning Code whilst in Toronto and loved the environment and people there that it made me want to follow this path even more.

                My top values and what I continue to look for in life are: 
                Helping people
                Continuiously looking for learning and growth opportunities
                Develop new skills from mentors and people that are more knowledgable than me 
                Honesty and integrity 
                Being Genuine and acting with good intentions towards others
                

                I tend to really respect and get along with people who are open minded and except peoples differences. I think it's important to feel comfortable in a work environment and whilst working with collegues to be able to express yourself and what you need to get the task done. This is also vitual when hoping to gain support and feedback for working in development. As a junior web developer I will need support and guidance from a mentor/senior developer until I feel that I know the code base and feel comfortable with the work I am coding in order to gain the desired outcome.
