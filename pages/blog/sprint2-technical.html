    <h2>The differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h2>
  Within Css the the position property can help you control the location of an element.
    
  <h3>Relative:</h3>
 An element’s original position remains in the flow of the document. But now left/right/top/bottom/z-index will work. The positional properties “nudge” the element from the original position in that direction.

 <h3>Absolute:</h3>
 The element is removed from the flow of the document and other elements will behave as if it’s not even there whilst all the other positional properties will work on it.

 <h3>Fixed positioning:</h3>
    The element is removed from the flow of the document like absolute positioned elements. They behave nearly the same however only fixed positioned elements are always relative to the document and are unaffected by scrolling.
