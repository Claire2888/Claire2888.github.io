    <h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h2>
  
    1. Keep Use of IDs and Classes to a Minimum
Unless IDs are needed for something other than styling, try to avoid them. 

2. Use Functional ID and Class Names

3. Use Generic ID and Class Names

4. Use Names That Are as Short as Possible But as Long as Necessary
Generally speaking, try to get to the point, but donâ€™t sacrifice comprehension.
