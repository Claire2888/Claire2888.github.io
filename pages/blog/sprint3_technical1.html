        <h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>

        HTML and CSS are like a house. The HTML is the building equipment for the house - the wood, structure and everything you need to get the frame of the house. 
        The CSS is the interior design of the house, the style e.g where the windows will go, what colours you will be painting the walls and everything that makes the structure of the house work and come alive. </p>

        <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</h3>



        <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
       
        <p>

        The DOM is the Document Object Model that is accessed through Developer tools and essentially is
        how Javascript interacts with the html within a website. It uses nodes (trees) to logically determine 
        from the html the structure of the documents and creates a way to change and manipulate them.

        <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.<h/3>
     
            <p>

            An object:
            An object is a collection of properties.
            
            An Array: 
            Array can be an object but is a special kind. 
            
            Arrays unlike objects are used to store a collection of data. 

        </p>

       <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>

       <p>
       
        A function essentially is used to wrap a bunch of code which performs an specific action. 
        Functions serve two purposes they groups statements together and makes your code reusable.
        It is rare that your code doesn't contain functions therefore it is an important aspect to understand and know how they work.
