          <h1>Learning plan</h1>

        <p>
            My long term goals are to eventually become a front end web developer. At this stage I am still new to everything in the developer space so I feel like I will get a better idea as I go along what I will enjoy to be focusing on long term and what my career aspirations will be after this course. 

            I would like to see my communication skills develop further. I do find that I am someone who will get the job done themselves and not reach out for others to help along the way despite enjoying working in team environments in the past therefore I would like to develop that further. 
            
            I believe I am passionate about the digital space, a hard worker and curious in nature. I'm always looking to grow and develop new skills which really excites me about becoming a web developer because you are forever learning new skills and evolving within the technology. 
            My limitations would be working on reaching out and utilising others skills to enhance my own and something I will be working on. 

            I will be managing my workload in this programme by each week working towards keeping to the timeslots allocated and reaching out at times that I am stuck to get help from my cohort or facilitators.
            I'll ensure that I don't spend more than 20-30mins on an issue without reaching out for assistance. 

            I expect from the facilitation team support and guidance when I need it. I'll make sure other commitments don't get in the way of my learning by ensuring that if I spend time away from studying in a day that I make up that time later. 
        </p>
