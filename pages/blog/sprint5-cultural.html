        <h1>Utilising your journal findings and the high level overview of the Core learnings you have covered in Foundations - answer each of the following questions:</h1>

        What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
        What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
        
        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?

What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What sort of impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?

What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?

Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed over the course of Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?

What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?

While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider here. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, or keeping focused for 9 weeks, etc.

What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?

At Dev Academy we have a large focus around human skills and improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?

For example, this could be things around communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your self awareness and reflective skills.

What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp

Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?

Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
