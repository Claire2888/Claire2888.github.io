        <h1>Utilising your journal findings and the high level overview of the Core learnings you have covered in Foundations - answer each of the following questions:</h1>

        What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
        What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
