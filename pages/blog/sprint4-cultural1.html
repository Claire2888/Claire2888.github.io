        <h3>Research Growth Mindset</h3>

            <p>

            Growth mindset is believing that your brain has the capability to learn and develop new skills. 
            It's the idea that as long as you apply yourself that you can always learn more and further your intelligence.Â 
            
            It is relevant to have the belief that if you keep at something and practice that you will eventually learn the 
            skill and have an understanding of what you are learning. 
            
            
            In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?



          

            I will be integrating growth mindset into my learning journey by believing in the 'not yet' strategy. 
            Knowing that on my journey as I learn all this new information that at anytime if I am confused by it 
            or feel that I haven't understood it enough to put it into action that I simply haven't practiced or learnt 
            enough to know what I am doing fully yet.
