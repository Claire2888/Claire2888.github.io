        <h3>Research Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h3>

            <p>
                Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to change itself. 
                It's  beneficial to understand the principles of neuroplasticity to know that you have the capability
                to form new pathways within your brain by learning new behaviours and developing them. 
                
                I can engage in the principles of neuroplasticity through repetition training and by learning about things 
                that are meaningful to me. By doing this I know that my brain is adapting and changing to form new neurons 
                which will benefit me by rewiring my brain with these new skills and forming connections through my learning 
                journey.

                Throughout my experience I can increase my neuroplasticity by learning new skills, thinking about 
                different things and experiencing different emotions. By doing this I will be forming new pathways 
                throughout my brain and can develop these further by connecting them as I continue throughout my study.

            <h3>Research Growth Mindset</h3>

            <p>

            Growth mindset is believing that your brain has the capability to learn and develop new skills. 
            It's the idea that as long as you apply yourself that you can always learn more and further your intelligence. 
            
            It is relevant to have the belief that if you keep at something and practice that you will eventually learn the 
            skill and have an understanding of what you are learning. 
            
            
            Something that surprised me during this learning was the concept of 'not yet' and how this isn't applied throughout 
            high school learning. It really blew my mind as I feel that when a student fails at some point it's so easy for them
            to get discouraged and stop trying. This is the perfect way to ensure that everyone understands that applying yourself
            will eventually give you the results you strive for. 

            What changed for me was understanding that you can form new neurons in your brain through repetitive learning and that 
            your brain is adaptable. 

    
            I will be integrating growth mindset into my learning journey by believing in the 'not yet' strategy. 
            Knowing that on my journey as I learn all this new information that at anytime if I am confused by it 
            or feel that I haven't understood it enough to put it into action that I simply haven't practiced or learnt 
            enough to know what I am doing fully yet.
