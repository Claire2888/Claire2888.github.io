        <h4>Solving a problem with Javascript</h4>
          

        The problem I was trying to solve was I had to write Javascript within Repl.it for the JS Objects and Variables tests. 
        From the very beginning of this problem I was stuck, I wasn't sure what it was asking for and tried guessing a few things that 
        I thought would give me some kind of positive results but nothing worked. 

        I then started applying problem solving techniques to this problem to see where I could find the right information and get a 
        clearer idea on how to approach it. 

        Googling was something I first tried but soon realise that since I didn't understand what it was asking me to do to run the test
         I therefore didn't know what to google to get anything close to the answers I wanted. I then decided to take a step back and use 
         pseudocode and the rubber ducky method to take a step back and understand what each step was asking and how to approach it with 
         an understanding of what the overall testing was asking of me. This really helped me get a clearer idea on what was required and 
         after reading through the slack foundations chat and seeing what other people also got stuck on I soon realised what I needed to do 
         to get started and from there the rest of the tests made sense and it all flowed on from there. 

         At the very beginning I felt beyond fustrated, I had no idea how to read the tests and run anything that would give me a correct result 
         and I felt overwhelmed after all the l




            What was the problem?
            What problem solving techniques did you use?
            How did you feel throughout the process?
            What did you learn?

            Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:

            Pseudocode
            Trying something
            Rubber ducky method
            Reading error messages
            Console.logging
            Googling
