        Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:
            Got blocked on a simple problem
            Solved a problem in an elegant way.


        In both cases:

            What was the problem?
            What problem solving techniques did you use?
            How did you feel throughout the process?
            What did you learn?

            Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:

            Pseudocode
            Trying something
            Rubber ducky method
            Reading error messages
            Console.logging
            Googling
            Asking your peers for help
            Asking coaches for help
            Improving your process with reflection
