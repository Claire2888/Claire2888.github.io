Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognise and evaluate your emotions with being able to expressing them in order to enhance thought.

EQ is different to IQ because it is about how your emotions are impacting what you are doing over if you are understanding the task at hand. 
It takes into account the emotions that a task can bring up and how you assess those emotions. 
        
It is important to develop EQ skills in order to understand others and yourself and know how to articulate your emotions into the work that you are doing. 
I think having a good understanding of your emotions and how they play a role of your behaviour and how you interact with others is important in any workplace.
