Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognise and evaluate your emotions and being able to expressing them in order to enhance action.
</p>

<p>
EQ is different to IQ because it is about how your emotions are impacting what you are doing over if you are understanding the task at hand. 
It takes into account the emotions that a task can bring up and how you assess and ultimately use those emotions. 
</p>    

<p>
It is important to develop EQ skills in order to understand others and yourself and know how to articulate your emotions into the work that you are doing. 
I think having a good understanding of your emotions and how they play a role in your behaviour and with the way you interact with others is important in any work environment.

It can show up in the way that a person manages stress, pressure, how you emphasis with others and show compassion towards peers. 
It represents an understanding and knowledge of what works for you and others in situations and within leadership roles it is expressed in the ability to make 
changes to support these skills and ensure they are managed with importance and appropriately for the benefit of others.
